# Splunk Extension for Visual Studio
#### Version 1.0

The Splunk extension for Visual Studio adds project templates to Visual Studio
to help in writing programs that access Splunk via the Splunk Software Development kit (SDK) for C# and writing modular inputs for Splunk in C#. It also provides tooling for configuring logging of events over UDP or TCP to Splunk Enterprise.

The extension adds to the Visual Studio software development platform to simplify creating projects using the Splunk SDK for C#. It provides:

* A new "Splunk SDK for C#" project template.
* A new "Splunk Modular Input" project template.
* A set of code snippets for common tasks using the Splunk SDK for C#.
* Optional support for logging events over UDP or TCP with .NET Trace Listeners or the Semantic Logging Application Block (SLAB)

Splunk is a search engine and analytic environment that uses a distributed
map-reduce architecture to efficiently index, search, and process large 
time-varying data sets.

The Splunk developer platform enables developers to take advantage of the 
same technology used by the Splunk product to build exciting new applications
that are enabled by Splunk's unique capabilities.
